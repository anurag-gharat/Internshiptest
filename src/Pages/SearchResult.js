                        <h3>The unique platform of Edunomics</h3>
                        <p className="font-weight-lighter">
                        This one of a kind platform is currently in construction, being devised with the most effectual and productive learning ecosystem for especially those students who have the urge to firstly find their deep hidden talents which they can excel with. And secondly for those curious souls who don't quite believe in the concept of learning merely by THEORETICAL ways. Who feel that a learning process should be stressed upon the PRACTICAL and real life scenarios because the things you grasp by such a realistic study, gets embedded into your memory with a profound clarity that no other teaching method can give you. Agreed? You surely must have felt this in your school and college days.
                        That is exactly what we are trying to offer students here at Edunomics, building a bridge between industry and academics. Since we are aware of the fact that a recorded descriptive video lecture or a written PDF'd notes or PPT can surely give you knowledge on the subject, but it's human psychology to start fast forwarding and glancing through it once you clasp the basic idea of what the topic is about. And yeah sometimes it can be a bit of a bore, right?
                        So how about an interactive and interesting (with a little bit of fun sprinkled) live video sessions by industry experts who will focus 30% on academics to lay your basic foundations strong and remaining 70% to practically train you with the latest up to date industry trends. Sounds compelling enough?
